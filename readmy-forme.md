the first steps :
    I wrote input (type range ) element and give it min and max values, also i gave it steps(tahts means the button will change numbers +4). also I fixed stabil value.
    2) I have second input, type "check" and its for click and afyter change month/year.this was ready code for it.

second :
    I used textcontent and not value or innerhtml and change textcontents.
    i used oninput event.(its necessary when element gets new input)
